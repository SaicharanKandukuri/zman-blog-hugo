So this is a test site for my new blog
here is a crazy thing
idk what to write for now

### My plans with this blog
so i started this blog for these reasons
- share some new things with you people ( by keeping this out of my mind: `this is freaking easy,every people know this!`)
- write some crazy tricks which i learnt and discovered
- make some new freinds and followers
- pack up some more motivation to write more software with your support ( like: [udroid](https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg/ubuntu-on-android) )

### here is a image for now
